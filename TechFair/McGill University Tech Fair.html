<p>There are a lot of things that you can do to prepare for meeting a potential employer. Here are a few suggestions.  Before you go to the TechFair make sure that you:  Visit the Engineering Career Centre for assistance in preparing for theTech Fair (You can also download our TechFair Tips handout). Students from other faculties can visit their respective career centres (full list available at http://www.mcgill.ca/caps/other-centres/). Pick up a Techfair booklet at the Engineering Career Centre or one of the tables throughout the Engineering buildings to research the employers that will be participating or view employer profiles through myFuture.

Take advantage of this opportunity to obtain first-hand information about careers which interest you. Consider asking the following questions:  What types of jobs does your company/organization have for university and college graduates? What academic background (major, program, courses) will be most helpful to me in preparing to enter this field? What kind of work experience, either part-time or internship, will be helpful to me? Are there internship opportunities in this field? What are typical entry-level positions in this field? What duties and responsibilities do these positions entail? How important is having "relevant" work experience when being considered for employment? What is the employment outlook in this field in the next 5 - 10 years? What are the opportunities and alternatives for career advancement? Would having a Master's or PhD degree be an advantage or disadvantage in obtaining a job with your company/organization? Are there extracurricular activities I can pursue which will help me prepare for this field? Does your company have training programs for its employees? What kind of salary can I expect in an entry-level position? How does your company/organization determine salary increases? What criteria does your company/organization use to assess candidates during interviews? Are there individuals in your company/organization who are willing to discuss their careers in more detail with me? What advice do you have for a university or college graduate entering this field?</p>
